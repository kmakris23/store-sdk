JWT (JSON Web Token) is a secure method for transmitting information between parties. It's perfect for stateless authentication in modern web applications and APIs.

Absolutely! You can configure token lifetimes using WordPress constants:
- `STORESDK_JWT_ACCESS_TTL` - Access token TTL (default: 1 hour)
